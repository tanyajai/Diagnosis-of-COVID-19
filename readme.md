# Diagnosis of COVID-19 and its clinical spectrum
## Statistical Data Mining-II


Given the current situation and surge in COVID-19 cases, we would like to explore this dataset to find
meaningful patterns using data mining and visualization techniques.
The dataset extracted from the below link:

**Kaggle Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/einsteindata4u/covid19

This dataset consists of patient data who visited Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). It
consists of samples that were collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (test for COVID-19) and
additional laboratory tests. All data is anonymized and standardized. 

There are 5644 records in 111 columns. We will investigate the data using EDA and transform the dataset to retain significant
COVID-19 test predictors. We will summarize the characteristics of the data and implement unsupervised
clustering algorithms such as SOM and K-means and derive insights from the data such as detecting if the
suspect is positive or negative for COVID-19 with the laboratory tests conducted.
